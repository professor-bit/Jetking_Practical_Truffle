1) Explain briefly the steps involved in initiating a project in Truffle
and demonstrate the same. 


Ans. Truffle is a popular development framework for Ethereum that simplifies the process of building, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Here’s a brief overview of the steps involved in initiating a project in Truffle, followed by a demonstration
Steps to Initiate a Project in Truffle
1. Install Truffle: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install Truffle globally using npm.
npm install -g truffle
2. Create a New Project: Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run: 
truffle init
This will set up a new Truffle project with a basic directory structure.
3. Set Up Your Development Environment: Install any necessary dependencies and set up your Truffle configuration file (truffle-config.js).
4. Write Smart Contracts: Create your smart contracts in the contracts directory. Truffle uses Solidity by default.
5. Migrate Contracts: Write migration scripts in the migrations directory to deploy your contracts to the blockchain.
6. Test Contracts: Write tests in the test directory using JavaScript or Solidity to ensure your contracts work as expected.
7. Deploy Contracts: Use Truffle commands to deploy your contracts to a local, test, or main network.
Demonstration: 
Create a New Project:
  

This will Create this:
  

Create a new file SimpleStorage.sol in the contracts directory:
  

Create a new migration script 2_deploy_contracts.js in the migrations directory:

  

Create a new test file test_simple_storage.js in the test directory:

  
Deploy the Contract: Make sure you have a local Ethereum network running, such as Ganache. Then, deploy your contract:
truffle migrate
Run the Tests: Execute the tests to ensure everything works correctly:
truffle test
