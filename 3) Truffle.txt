3) Demonstrate the process of deploying smart contracts on
Ganache using Truffle suite. 


Ans. The process of deploying Smart contracts on Ganache using Truffle Suite are:


1. Install Truffle and Ganache using the commands on command window:
npm install -g truffle
npm install -g ganache-cli
2. Start Ganache: 
Ganache-cli
3. Initialize a truffle project
Create a New Truffle Project: In your terminal, navigate to your desired directory and initialize a new Truffle project:
mkdir MyTruffleProject
cd MyTruffleProject
truffle init
   4. Create a Solidity File: In the contracts directory, create a new file called SimpleStorage.sol:
  

   5. Configure Truffle to Connect to Ganache
Update truffle-config.js: Open the truffle-config.js file and configure it to connect to Ganache. Add or update the development network configuration
   6. Create a Migration Script: In the migrations directory, create a new migration script called 2_deploy_contracts.js:
  

   7. Deploy the Contract
Compile the Contract: Compile your Solidity contracts by running:
truffle compile
   8. Deploy the Contract: Deploy your contract to the Ganache network by running:
truffle migrate --network development
   9. Interact with the Deployed Contract
Open Truffle Console: To interact with your deployed contract, open the Truffle console:
truffle console --network development
      10. Interact with the Contract: Once in the console, you can interact with your deployed contract. 
// Get the deployed contract instance
let instance = await SimpleStorage.deployed();


// Set a value
await instance.set(42);


// Get the value
let value = await instance.get();
console.log(value.toString());  // Should print "42"
By following these steps, you should be able to write, compile, and deploy a Solidity smart contract to a local Ganache blockchain using Truffle, and interact with it via the Truffle console.
